Minimal Cocoa App for Basic Animation
=====================================

The source here shows how to initialize and run a Cocoa app but doing the work yourself.
It also shows how to create a custom content view and updates and blits it to the screen non-stop.

Created as part of my efforts to create a Mac version of the Handmade Hero project.
See http://handmadehero.org/ for more.
